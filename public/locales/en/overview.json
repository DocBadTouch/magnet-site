  "text1": "Magnet DAO is the evolution of the reserve currency protocol. The DAO uses its protocol controlled value to reward token holders with market-beating yields. At the same time, it uses its treasury reserves to invest in and incubate innovative projects.",
  "text2": "Unlike first-generation reserve currency protocols, the goal of Magnet DAO isnâ€™t just to grow its market cap. Instead, it uses its treasury assets to acquire and invest in high-quality crypto assets, effectively turning the DAO into an on-chain venture fund. Since all fees and value accrued from these assets is distributed directly to token holders, Magnet DAO creates exponential value for all its investors.",  
  "text3": "Magnet DAO is the next stage of the tried and tested reserve currency model. While building a sufficient treasury is important for a protocol, the portfolio management of that treasury is equally as important. We are hyper focused on putting the treasury to use to generate return, including building, incubating, and investing in early-stage projects - opportunities that are typically not available to the average investor.",
